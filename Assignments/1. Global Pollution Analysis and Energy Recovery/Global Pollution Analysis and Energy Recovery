Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery

Objective
 The goal is to analyze global pollution data and develop strategies for pollution reduction and converting pollutants into energy. The dataset will be used for both data preprocessing and building regression models to predict energy recovery from pollution levels.
Phase 1: Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Step 1 - Data Import and Preprocessing
Datasets
 Load the dataset (Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv).


Handle Missing Values
 Identify missing or inconsistent data, and handle them using appropriate imputation strategies.


Data Transformation


Normalize or scale pollution indices (air, water, and soil).
Encode categorical features such as Country and Year using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics
 Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical features like CO2_Emissions and Industrial_Waste_in_tons.


Correlation Analysis
 Visualize the correlation between pollution levels and other features like energy consumption using a heatmap.


Visualizations
 Create bar charts, line plots, and box plots to explore trends in pollution over time and across countries.


Step 3 - Feature Engineering
Yearly Trends
 Extract year-based trends to understand how pollution and energy recovery have evolved over time.


Energy Consumption per Capita
 Calculate energy consumption per capita for better analysis.



Phase 2: Predictive Modeling
Step 4 - Linear Regression Model (for Pollution Prediction)
Model Objective
 Predict energy recovery (in GWh) based on pollution levels, industrial waste, and other features.


Model Building
 Train a Linear Regression model to predict energy recovery using features like Air_Pollution_Index, CO2_Emissions, and Industrial_Waste_in_tons.


Evaluation Metrics
 Use R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.


Step 5 - Logistic Regression Model (for Categorization of Pollution Levels)
Model Objective
 Classify countries into pollution severity categories (Low, Medium, High).


Model Implementation
 Use Logistic Regression to classify pollution severity based on features like Air_Pollution_Index and CO2_Emissions.


Evaluation Metrics
 Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and plot the Confusion Matrix.



Phase 3: Reporting and Insights
Step 6 - Model Evaluation and Comparison
Compare Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models based on their performance and metrics.
Visualize results using confusion matrices and classification reports.
Step 7 - Actionable Insights
Provide insights on how different pollution levels affect energy recovery and suggest countries that could benefit from improvement.
Offer recommendations for reducing pollution and improving energy recovery.

Final Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing the entire code and analysis.
Data Visualizations in image format or embedded in the notebook.
Final Report summarizing key findings, model evaluations, and actionable recommendations.
